VBCS Feedback Management System

Oracle Cloud End-to-End Integration Project

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete cloud-native integration solution built using Oracle Visual Builder Cloud Service (VBCS), Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC), and Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP).

The application captures user information and feedback through a validated frontend form and securely stores the data in an ATP database via a REST-based OIC integration.

🏗 Solution Architecture
